 - Tamaized: Fixed an exploit that would set a player's max health to 1024
 - Tamaized: Overhauled the entire internal Voidic Infusion code to be much nicer and easier to work around.
  * Because of this, things may or may not appear much smoother such as the various rendering of voidic infusion effects
 - Tamaized: Voidic Suppressor max amount of Voidic Power has been increased to 20000
  * It now drains at a rate of 1 per tick rather than 1 per second.
  * To get the new max value, recraft the Voidic Suppressor as old ones will retain the max value of 2000
