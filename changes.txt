 - Tamaized: Added config file with options to change dimension IDs
 - Tamaized: Nerfed Heimdall
  * Heimdall now requires either Void Infused Quartz Dust or Forge Energy
  * The amount generated no longer depends on the Y level
  * Quartz dust is converted into Forge Energy in the block, the amount is 144*5 or 720
  * The ratio between Forge Energy and Liquid Void is 5:1 which means 1 Quartz Dust is equal to 144mb
 - Tamaized: Added Herobrine Creepers and Shulkers to Void Fortresses
