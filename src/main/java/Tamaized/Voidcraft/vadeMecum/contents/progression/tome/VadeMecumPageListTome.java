The only explanation is that the Vade Mecum is opening small rifts to specific sections in the void to unleash such powers. To ready your Vade Mecum for a Word you must first select a Word."),

To actually use a word, simply Right Click. To deactivate the Vade Mecum, Shift Right Click again. Words of Power can only be used a limited amount of times but they can be recharged."),
