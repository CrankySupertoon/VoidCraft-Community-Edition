# VoidCraft

## About
This is a very very alpha stage of a mod.

The mod is about further exploration into the depths of the so called *Void*.

To get started, simply enter The End and search for the Void Crystal Ore. Each ore will drop 2 Void Crystals, combine 9 of the crystals together in a crafting table to form a block of crystal Void. From there you must Build a nether style portal and light the portal with a Void Crystal and Steel (Just a flint and steel with a single crystal).

The rest is for you to discover.
