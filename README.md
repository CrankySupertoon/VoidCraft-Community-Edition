# VoidCraft

## About
The mod is our interpritation of what lurks deep within the one of Minecraft's oldest, yet mostly untouched environments: The infinitely expasnive *Void*.

No plane in existance can escape being touched by the abyss that lies beneath their layer of bedrock...
But despite it touching every world, enetring it is no simple task. If anyone or anything tries to enter it from holes in bedrock, a destructive force will eat away at it's material being. Though, if one could somehow survive falling through this voilent barrier long enough, they *might* end up in the inner void.
...Though making something that could withstand the void would probably take an exceedingly long time...

The easiest way to enter the void is to harvest Void Crystals from the Dimesnsion Closest to it: The End.
Once there, one can search for Void Crystals bound to the the native whitestone. Each ore will drop always drop 1 to 3 Void Crystals, regardless of one's fortune. After gathering a large sum of Crystalized Void, combine nine of them together in a crafting table to form a Void Crystal Block. With these new blocks in hand, construct a portal frame and activate it by throwing Void into it from an Obsidian Flask. The Crystals will resonate with the void's power, and create a portal that will safely trasnsport matter into the inner void, bypassing the destructive protective layer that surrounds it.

After stepping through the portal, you'll be in the Void, a black abyss where only powerful ethereal spirits can survive. All other creatures will slowly die in the hostile environment, including you. However, if you can brave the Void and infuse it's etherial essence with your tools, it could yeild powerful results...
