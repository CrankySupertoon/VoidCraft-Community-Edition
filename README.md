# VoidCraft

## About
The mod is our interpretation of what lurks deep within the one of Minecraft's oldest, yet mostly untouched environments: The infinitely expansive Void.

No plane in existence can escape being touched by the abyss that lies beneath their layer of bedrock... But despite it touching every world, entering it is no simple task. If anyone or anything tries to enter it from holes in bedrock, a destructive force will eat away at its material being. Though, if one could somehow survive falling through this violent barrier long enough, they might end up in the inner void. ...Though making something that could withstand the void would probably take an exceedingly long time...

The easiest way to enter the void is to harvest Void Crystals from the Dimension closest to it: The End. Once there, one can search for Void Crystals bound to the native whitestone. Each ore will always drop 1 to 3 Void Crystals, regardless of one's fortune. After gathering a large sum of Crystallized Void, combine nine of them together in a crafting table to form a Void Crystal Block. With these new blocks in hand, construct a portal frame and activate it by throwing Void into it from an Obsidian Flask. The Crystals will resonate with the void's power, and create a portal that will safely transport matter into the inner void, bypassing the destructive protective layer that surrounds it.

After stepping through the portal, you'll be in the Void, a black abyss where only powerful ethereal spirits can survive. All other creatures will slowly die in the hostile environment, including you. However, if you can brave the Void and infuse it's ethereal essence with your tools, it could yield powerful results...
